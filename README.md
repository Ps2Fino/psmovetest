PS Move Test
==========
Simple one class-r for testing the PS Move. Feel free to mod

Compilation
==========
Simply clone the repo and run `make` from the root directory of the project. The project builds for OSX but is **not** cross-platform due to the pre-build shared libraries for mac.

Instructions
==========
Make sure there are controllers connected to the bluetooth stack before running the program. For details, see the repo of the PS Move APi project at [https://thp.io/2010/psmove/](https://thp.io/2010/psmove/)

Cheers
