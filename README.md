PS Move Test
==========
Simple one class-r for testing the PS Move. Feel free to mod

Compilation
==========
Simply clone the repo and run `make` from the root directory of the project. The project builds for OSX but is **not** cross-platform due to the pre-build shared libraries for mac.

Instructions
==========
Make sure there are controllers connected to the bluetooth stack before running the program. For details, see the repo of the PS Move APi project at [https://thp.io/2010/psmove/](https://thp.io/2010/psmove/)

About
=====
This is actually the source code for the game we made at the 5th UBISS in Oulu, Finland, June 2014.
We won the best project award, and we published a short paper on the game in the 1st SIGCHI Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play.
The associated CHIPlay published paper can be found [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2658537.2661309)
